# SupiriAccounts PWA - GitHub Pages Deployment Checklist

This checklist helps ensure that your SupiriAccounts PWA is properly configured for GitHub Pages deployment and ready for business use.

## Pre-Deployment Configuration

### Path References

- [ ] All script tags in index.html use relative paths (`./src/` instead of `../src/`)
- [ ] All image references use relative paths (`./src/images/` instead of `../images/`)
- [ ] CSS references use relative paths (`./src/css/` instead of `../css/`)
- [ ] Service worker references all required files with correct paths
- [ ] Manifest.json uses correct paths for icon references

### File Inclusion

- [ ] All required JavaScript files are included in index.html
- [ ] Service worker includes all needed assets in cache list
- [ ] All views and components are properly referenced
- [ ] Latest utility files (data-manager.js, business-analytics.js) are included
- [ ] Third-party libraries are included (Bootstrap, Chart.js, etc.)

### Code Validation

- [ ] No syntax errors in JavaScript files
- [ ] No console errors during basic functionality testing
- [ ] Service worker registers successfully
- [ ] PWA installs correctly on test devices

## Deployment Process

### Repository Setup

1. [ ] Create GitHub repository for the project
2. [ ] Configure GitHub Pages in repository settings:
   - Select branch to deploy from (main/master)
   - Ensure root directory is selected as source
   - Note the published URL from GitHub Pages settings

### Deployment Methods

**Method 1: Manual Upload**
- [ ] Upload all files to the GitHub repository
- [ ] Verify all files were uploaded successfully
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions for any deployment errors

**Method 2: Using Deploy Script**
- [ ] Run the deploy-to-github.ps1 script:
  ```powershell
  .\deploy-to-github.ps1 -RepoUrl "https://github.com/username/repo-name.git" -Branch "main"
  ```
- [ ] Verify script execution completed successfully
- [ ] Check GitHub Actions for deployment status

**Method 3: GitHub Actions Workflow**
- [ ] Ensure github-workflow-deploy.yml is in the repository
- [ ] Trigger workflow manually or through push
- [ ] Monitor workflow execution in Actions tab
- [ ] Verify successful deployment

## Post-Deployment Testing

### Functionality Verification

- [ ] Access the published GitHub Pages URL
- [ ] Verify the app loads correctly
- [ ] Test user registration and login
- [ ] Check that all navigation links work
- [ ] Verify offline functionality by turning off internet
- [ ] Test data storage and retrieval
- [ ] Verify business analytics features work correctly

### Mobile Testing

- [ ] Test on Android device(s)
- [ ] Test on iOS device(s)
- [ ] Verify "Add to Home Screen" functionality
- [ ] Test offline usage after installation
- [ ] Verify touch interactions work properly
- [ ] Check responsive layout on different screen sizes

### PWA Features

- [ ] Verify app installs to home screen
- [ ] Check if app launches in standalone mode
- [ ] Test offline functionality after installation
- [ ] Verify service worker updates when new version is deployed
- [ ] Check that cached assets are served correctly

## Business Readiness

- [ ] Business guide documentation is complete and accurate
- [ ] Data backup/restore features work correctly
- [ ] Business analytics provide accurate insights
- [ ] Export/import functionality works correctly
- [ ] All business-critical features have been tested

## Common Issues and Solutions

### HTTP vs HTTPS

GitHub Pages serves content over HTTPS. Ensure all resources (including third-party libraries) are loaded over HTTPS to avoid mixed content warnings.

### 404 Errors

If you're seeing 404 errors for assets:
1. Check that file paths are correct
2. Verify files were uploaded to the repository
3. Ensure case sensitivity matches (GitHub Pages URLs are case-sensitive)

### Service Worker Registration Fails

If service worker doesn't register:
1. Check browser console for errors
2. Verify service-worker.js is in the root directory
3. Ensure the registration path is correct

### Client-side Routing Issues

If routes don't work after refreshing:
1. Implement a 404.html file with redirect script
2. Use hash-based routing (which is already implemented in SupiriAccounts)

## Final Deployment URL

After successful deployment, your SupiriAccounts PWA will be available at:
`https://[username].github.io/[repository-name]/`

Remember to keep your deployed application updated when making significant changes to the codebase. The GitHub Pages site will automatically update when changes are pushed to the deployment branch.
