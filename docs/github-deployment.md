# GitHub Pages Deployment Instructions

## Preparation Steps

1. Create a GitHub account if you don't have one
2. Make sure all your files are ready for deployment
3. Run these commands to prepare the deployment

## Deployment Commands

```powershell
# Initialize a new Git repository
git init

# Add all files to the repository
git add .

# Commit the changes
git commit -m "Initial commit of SupiriAccounts PWA"

# Create a new repository on GitHub first, then:
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/supiriaccounts.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main

# Set up GitHub Pages in your repository settings
# Go to Settings > Pages > Source > select "main" branch and "/docs" or "/(root)" folder
```

## Important Notes

- Your site will be available at `https://YOUR-USERNAME.github.io/supiriaccounts/`
- It might take a few minutes for GitHub to deploy your site
- Every time you make changes, push them to GitHub to update your live site

```powershell
git add .
git commit -m "Update description"
git push origin main
```
